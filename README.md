CIDO: Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology

The emergence of the Wuhan Coronavirus infectious disease has reminded everyone the early versions of the SARS coronavirus outbreak and the Middle East coronavirus outbreak. These coronavirus infections make us realize that it is critical to systematically study these coronavirus infectious diseases using the cutting edge technologies. Ontology provides a unique angle to study the coronavirus infectious diseases.  

The Ontology of Coronavirus Infectious Disease (CIDO) is a community-driven open-source biomedical ontology in the area of coronavirus infectious disease. The CIDO is developed to provide standardized human- and computer-interpretable annotation and representation of various coronavirus infectious diseases, including their etiology, transmission, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.
