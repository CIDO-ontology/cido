CIDO: Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology

The emerging [Wuhan coronavirus outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Wuhan_coronavirus_outbreak) has reminded everyone the early versions of the [SARS coronavirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome-related_coronavirus) outbreak and the [Middle East coronavirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome-related_coronavirus) outbreak. These [coronavirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus) infections make us realize that it is critical to systematically study these coronavirus infectious diseases using the cutting edge technologies. Ontology provides a unique angle to study the coronavirus infectious diseases.  

The Ontology of Coronavirus Infectious Disease (CIDO) is a community-driven open-source biomedical ontology in the area of coronavirus infectious disease. The CIDO is developed to provide standardized human- and computer-interpretable annotation and representation of various coronavirus infectious diseases, including their etiology, transmission, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.
