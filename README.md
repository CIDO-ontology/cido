CIDO: Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology

The emerging [COVID-19 outbreak](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) has reminded everyone the early versions of the [SARS coronavirus outbreak](https://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/) and the [Middle East coronavirus outbreak](https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/). These [coronavirus](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus) outbreaks have made us realize the critical importance of systematically studying these coronavirus infectious diseases using the cutting edge technologies. Ontology provides a unique angle to study the coronavirus infectious diseases.  

The Ontology of Coronavirus Infectious Disease (CIDO) is a community-driven open-source biomedical ontology in the area of coronavirus infectious disease. The CIDO is developed to provide standardized human- and computer-interpretable annotation and representation of various coronavirus infectious diseases, including their etiology, transmission, epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. Its development follows the OBO Foundry Principles.

CIDO has now been approved to be an OBO Foundry library ontology: http://obofoundry.org/ontology/cido.html.

### CIDO Developers:
CIDO was initiated and co-led by Dr. Hong Yu, director of Department of Respiratory and critical Care Medicine，Guizhou Province People’s Hospital,  Guizhou University Medical College, Guiyang, Guizhou, China, and Dr. Yongqun Oliver He, Associate Professor, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. 

Many graduate students, clinical doctors, and researchers in the [He laboratory](http://www.hegroup.org) and Guizhou Province People’s Hospital have also participated in the CIDO development.  

Many researchers in the University of Michigan, including [Dr. Brian Athey](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/dcmb/brian-d-athey-phd) and [Dr. Gil Omenn](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/dcmb/gilbert-s-omenn-md-phd), have participated in the CIDO development.

[Dr. Junguk Hur](https://med.und.edu/labs/hur/) from University of North Dakoda Medical School is also a CIDO developer. Dr. Hur is also interested in applying CIDO for more efficient literature mining. 

Everyone who would like to contribute to the CIDO development is welcome to join our development team. Thanks.

### News: 
- 3/12/2020: Oliver transferred the CIDO github organization location from github.com/biomedontology to the newly generated https://github.com/CIDO-ontology organization. Such a transfer is to better support its organization with more options (such as generating new repositories). 
- 3/12/2020: Oliver generated the new CIDO-ontology github organization. 
- 2/3/2020: Oliver submitted a request for the CIDO namespace in OBO-discuss email. See the email and discussions in OBO community here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/obo-discuss/AAZnGWe5eEE  
- 1/26/2020: CIDO was submitted to Ontobee and BioPortal.
