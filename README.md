CIDO: Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology

The emerging [COVID-19 outbreak](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) has reminded everyone the early versions of the [SARS coronavirus outbreak](https://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/) and the [Middle East coronavirus outbreak](https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/). These [coronavirus](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus) outbreaks have made us realize the critical importance of systematically studying these coronavirus infectious diseases using the cutting edge technologies. Ontology provides a unique angle to study the coronavirus infectious diseases.  

The Ontology of Coronavirus Infectious Disease (CIDO) is a community-driven open-source biomedical ontology in the area of coronavirus infectious disease. The CIDO is developed to provide standardized human- and computer-interpretable annotation and representation of various coronavirus infectious diseases, including their etiology, transmission, epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. Its development follows the OBO Foundry Principles.

CIDO has now been approved to be an OBO library ontology: http://obofoundry.org/ontology/cido.html.

### CIDO Developers:
CIDO was initiated and co-led by Dr. Hong Yu, director of Department of Respiratory and critical Care Medicine，Guizhou Province People’s Hospital,  Guizhou University Medical College, Guiyang, Guizhou, China, and Dr. Yongqun Oliver He, Associate Professor, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. 

[He laboratory](http://www.hegroup.org) at the University of Michigan actively participated in the CIDO development. In addition to Oliver He, four graduate students (Anthony Huffman, Yingtong Liu, Edison Ong, and Yang Wang), and several undergraduate students (including Easheta Shah, Roshan Desai) have actively involved in the CIDO development.  
 
Drs. Hong Yu and Yang Wang from Guizhou Province People’s Hospital have also participated in the CIDO development. Dr. Yang Wang (M.D.) is also a PhD student in Biomedical Informatics and she is currently a visiting PhD student in He laboratory. 

Many researchers in the University of Michigan, including [Dr. Brian Athey](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/dcmb/brian-d-athey-phd) and [Dr. Gil Omenn](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/dcmb/gilbert-s-omenn-md-phd), have participated in the CIDO development.

[Dr. Junguk Hur](https://med.und.edu/labs/hur/) from University of North Dakoda Medical School is also a CIDO developer. Dr. Hur is also interested in applying CIDO for more efficient literature mining. 

[Dr. Barry Smith](http://www.buffalo.edu/cas/philosophy/faculty/faculty_directory/smith-b.html), a well-known ontologist from the University at Buffalo, is also a member of our CIDO development team. Dr. Smith developed the [Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)](https://basic-formal-ontology.org/), a top level ontology used by over 300 ontologies around the world. BFO has now been approved to become [ISO/IEC standard 21838](https://www.iso.org/standard/71954.html). CIDO is aligned with BFO, and by doing so, CIDO is aligned with the other hundreds of ontologies. 

[John Beverley](https://www.philosophy.northwestern.edu/people/graduate-students/john-beverley.html), an expert in the area where ontology and logic meet, has been working on developing the modeling of viral infectious diseases as an extension of the core of Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO). John has joined our CIDO development. 

[Dr. Asiyah Yu Lin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dryulin), M.D., Ph.D., an Health Scientist at FDA and an ontology expert. Asiyah is an affiliated ontologist in the National Center for Ontology Research.     

Dr. Xiaolin Yang, an experienced ontologist and bioinformatician from the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, [School of Basic Medicine](http://sbm.pumc.edu.cn/), [Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences](http://www.pumc.edu.cn), Beijing, China, has also participated in our collaborative CIDO development and applications.

[Dr. Bill Duncan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/biduncan/), Software Developer at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Buffalo, New York. 

[Dr. Sivaram Arabandi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sivaramarabandi/), MD, MS., a clinical informatician and founder of [ONTOPRO LLC](http://ontopro.com/) with over 15 years of multidisciplinary clinical and information technology experience.

[Dr. Liwei Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=QVp3dZIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Dr. Hongfang Liu](https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/liu-hongfang-ph-d/bio-00055092), medical informatics experts from Mayo Clinic who are using CIDO to support OHNLP clinical COVID-19 NLP research.
